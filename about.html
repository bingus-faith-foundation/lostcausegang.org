    <p><span class="bold-name">Lost Cause Gang</span> emerged from <i>Lost Voice</i>, an electronic hip-hop duo founded
        in 2018
        by artist producer <i>Yung
            North</i> and producer <i>alexwenthome</i>. Duo grew into an independent five-person collective in less
        than a year. Due to disagreements among the collective's members, it never produced any results and
        fell apart later that year with only its founding members remaining, who eventually changed their stage names to
        <i>Sever.Ami</i>
        and <i>alxwnth</i>.
